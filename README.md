# 🌿 Crop Health using Computer Vision

This project uses deep learning (specifically CNNs) to detect plant diseases from images of leaves. The idea is to help farmers — especially in areas with limited access to agricultural experts — identify plant diseases early using just a photo.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Classifies leaf images into healthy or diseased categories  
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow  
- Trained on the **New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)** from Kaggle  
- Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score  
- Aims to support real-world use via mobile or web-based platforms  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Kaggle for the dataset

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes images of plant leaves — both healthy and affected by various diseases — organized into folders per class.

**Source:**  
[Kaggle - New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

- ~38 classes (including multiple diseases per crop)  
- Pre-augmented and resized to 128x128 RGB  
- One-hot encoded labels for multi-class classification
- Note: Make sure to download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the **data/** directory.

## 📊 Results

The CNN model achieved strong performance on the validation set, with most misclassifications occurring between visually similar diseases. The results suggest good potential for field use, especially if wrapped in a mobile app for farmers.

## Directory Structure:

1. "data" folder containing sample test images

2. "model" folder contains file history of model training & you can download the trained model from [here](https://huggingface.co/vishalsai0234/trained_model.keras/blob/main/trained_model.keras))

3. "notebooks" folder containing jupyter notebooks

4. "src" folder contains image file & python file (used for prediction of leaf images on web interface via streamlit)

5. "Crop_Health_using_CV_Report.pdf" report for this project

6. "README.md" file

7. "requirements.txt" python libraries with version required for this project

---

## Commands:

1. Open jupyter notebook/ google collab & run the jupyter notebook files one by one

2. After running "2_Model_Building_&_Training.ipynb" file successfully, a new file called "trained_model.keras" is created in the folder.

3. Now, use this "trained_model.keras" file in further notebook & python file

4. Then open a terminal from the folder which contains this files

5. Type "streamlit run main.py" & run it in terminal to predict the type of leaf image with disease

6. If you getting error then proceed with using following commands in terminal (to create new environment):
  - conda create -n tf_env python=3.10
  - conda activate tf_env
  - conda install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
  - streamlit run main.py

Now, terminal automatically open web browser for streaming.
